[Kasane Teto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqK-jh4TDXo) is a virtual singer software using voice synthesis software UTAU. The character was initially created as a joke for April Fools' Day 2008 on the Japanese textboard 2channel, but she was later made into an actual voicebank. Teto has been introduced as a "diva born from a hoax".

Kasane Teto was also released as a voice model in 2021 for TALQu, a deep learning-based free speech software, in 2023 for Synthesizer V AI, a commercial singing voice synthesis software, and in 2025 for VOICEPEAK, a text-to-speech software.
